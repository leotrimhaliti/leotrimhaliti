# Hey, I'm Leotrim 

I'm a **full-stack web developer** based in Prishtina 🇽🇰. I enjoy building fast, clean, and functional apps — usually with **React** on the frontend and **Node.js** on the backend. I like projects that solve real problems (or at least feel fun to build).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages:** JavaScript, C#, SQL  
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Tools:** Git, Netlify, Firebase, PostgreSQL, VS Code  

## 💡 A Few Projects

### 🎯 [CS2 Crosshair Demo Extractor](https://github.com/leotrimhaliti)  
Tired of pausing demos to copy someone’s crosshair? This tool extracts it straight from a CS2 demo file — load, grab, play.

### ⌨️ [Text Speed Racer](https://textspeedracer.netlify.app/)  
A typing game where you race against an AI that *adapts* to your speed. Go slow and it chills. Go fast and it pushes back. Built to sharpen your typing without boring drills.
